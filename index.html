            <p>After twenty-six years as an educator, I am exploring a new career combining my interests in books, graphic design, writing, and computer programming.</p>
            <p>Throughout my tenure as an elementary school librarian, I developed a keen interest in children's publishing. I curated a library collection tailored to the diverse interests and needs of the  student population. To stay current with the last publications, I read voraciously, attended BookExpo for many years, followed authors and illustrators on social media and perused print and digital book reviews.</p>
            <p>My foray into graphic design began with my role as the editor of an annual publication for Boston College's student programming. Utilizing Adobe Pagemaker, I took a lead role in the publishing process‚Äîfrom writing and editing to proofreading, meeting with printers, and scrutinizing the mockup before the final print. This experience served as a springboard for my subsequent ventures in creating both print and digital materials, including brochures, flyers, and informational booklets, using tools such as Microsoft Publisher, Adobe InDesign, as well as online platforms like Canva and Book Creator. </p>
          
            <p>Over the last six months, I've been wholeheartedly immersed in mastering the fundamentals of computer programming. My coursework has been predominantly centered around HTML and CSS, with a brief introduction to Javascript. The culmination of my efforts is evident in the creation of this website. I am now eager to secure a position that provides me with the creative outlet to apply and expand upon my newly developed skills.</p>
                
            <p>As an educator, a novice programmer, and a lifelong learner, I wholeheartedly adopt a growth mindset. As a teaching professional, I had to identify and address a myriad challenges, learning and adapting with each possible solution. As a school librarian, I adeptly balanced the responsibilities of independently managing and overseeing the library facility with the opportunities to collaborate with my colleagues.

            In this dynamic environment, I consistently sought answers to my questions and, each year, dedicated myself to self-directed learning, utilizing various resources to enhance both my teaching methodologies and my students' overall learning experiences. I firmly believe in leading by example, demonstrating that it is never too late to pursue one's interests.</p>
             
            <p>I possess various hobbies that keep me engaged. I've expanded my baking skills through classes at the King Arthur Baking School in Vermont. Beyond the kitchen, I find joy in knitting and quilting, creating beautiful and functional pieces for myself and others. Recently, I have found joy in exploring my own storytelling talents with the Westport Writers' Workshops. I also enjoy playing golf, learning how to row and finding my balance on a paddleboard. This mix of pursuits ensures that my days are rich with both relaxation and invigorating challenges.
            </p>

            <p>I've incorporated my interest in travel with my portfolio of projects. My pictures feature some of my favorite destinations, both near and far. They are buttons that will bring you to examples of my work.</p>
