            <p>After twenty-six years as an educator I have decided to follow a new career path in the computer programming world. My first start in coding was back in the 1990s when education was in the infant stages of getting connected. Another teacher and I started working with HTML to craft the schools first website. My interest in technology as a tool in educattion continued to grow and I earned my first Master's degree in Technology Education. I became a leader in incorporating tech tools and instruction, seeking out ways to help students see tech as a tool not as a toy. My second Master's degree in school-library media and my National Board Certified Teacher portfolio offer more opportunities to explore this path.</p>
            <p>As an educator, I honed my skills in identifying challenges and developing solutions. I expressed my creativity with videos, websites, and interactive tech tools. I sought the answers to questions and each year I taught myself how to use resources to improve my teaching and my students' experiences. This skillset is part of being a strong programmer. I am now applying these skills developed for the past twenty-six years in a new setting. My motto is to keep learning and to keep growing.</p>
            <p>I have many interests to keep me busy. I like to bake and I've taken classes at the King Arthur Baking School in Vermont. I knit, make quilts, read and write stories. I enjoy playing golf, paddle boarding and I'm learning to row.</p>
            <p>I enjoy visiting new places. In the projects section will see images of places I've been. I used them as buttons for my projects. As much as I like travel,I do enjoy being home to spoil our two pups, Lila and Riggins. Both are cocker spaniel rescues. Lila was found as a stray in rural Georgia. Riggins was found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas. A huge thank you to the rescue groups that helped bring them to us. Lila and Riggins are completely spoiled and loved. They are my constant companions. Many people ask about their names. If you're a fan of the TV show <i>Friday Night Lights,</i> you know the characters Lyla Garrity and Tim Riggins. "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose."</p>
