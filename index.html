            <p>After twenty-six years as an educator, I am exploring a new career combining my interests in books,graphic design, writing, and computer programming.</p>
            <p>During my years an elementary school librarian and an avid reader, I developed a strong background in children's publishing. I curated a library collection responsive to the interests and needs of the population. My interest in graphic design began as the editor of the annual publication of available campus programming at Boston College. I created the publication using Adobe Pagemaker. I was involved in the many aspects of the publishing process from writing, editing, proofreading, meeting with printers and reviewing the mockup before the final before going to print. Over the years, I transferred the knowledge gained from that experience in creating print and digital brochures, flyers, and informational booklets using Microsoft Publisher and Adobe's InDesign as well online creation tools like Canva and Book Creator. </p>
          
            <p>For the past six months, I dedicated my time learning the basics of computer programming. My coursework has focused on HTML and CSS with a brief introduction to Javascript. I created this website using what I have learned this far. I hope to find a position that offers me the opportunity to apply my new skills in a creative manner.</p>
                
            <p>As an educator, as a beginning programmer, as a perpetual learner, I have embraced a growth mindset. Teaching requires one to identify challenges and develop solutions on a daily basis. As a school librarian, I balanced the demands of working independently as the adminisrator and custodian of the library facility with the opportunities to work with my colleagues. I sought the answers to my questions and each year I taught myself how to use resources to improve my teaching and my students' experiences. Modeling by example it's  never too late to follow your interests.</p>
             
            <p>I have many interests to keep me busy. I like to bake and I've taken classes at the King Arthur Baking School in Vermont. I knit, make quilts, read and write stories. I like playing golf, paddle boarding and learning to row.</p>

            <p>I enjoy visiting new places and in the projects section you will see images from my travels. Click on the pictures to see examples of my work.</p>
